# Segment Ordering Fix - V2 Implementation

## Issue
The V2 implementation was producing segments in the order they were processed/created rather than in their actual byte position order within the Parquet file. This made it difficult to read the file sequentially.

### Before Fix
Segments appeared in this order:
1. `parquet_header` [0, 4]
2. `parquet_footer_magic` [738, 742] ❌ Out of order
3. `footer_size` [734, 738] ❌ Out of order  
4. `parquet_footer` [130, 734] ❌ Out of order
5. `row_group` [4, 64] ❌ Out of order

### After Fix
Segments now appear in correct sequential byte order:
1. `parquet_header` [0, 4] ✅
2. `row_group` [4, 64] ✅ 
3. `parquet_footer` [130, 734] ✅
4. `footer_size` [734, 738] ✅
5. `parquet_footer_magic` [738, 742] ✅

## Solution
Added a single line of code in `analyze_parquet_file_v2()` function:

```python
# Sort segments by their byte position in the file for proper sequential reading
segments.sort(key=lambda segment: segment["range"][0])
```

## Testing
- ✅ All 42 V2 tests continue to pass
- ✅ Segments now appear in correct byte order
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Maintains hierarchical structure within segments

## Files Modified
- `parquet_lens_v2.py`: Added segment sorting line
- `output_v2_final.json`: Updated with correctly ordered output

## Impact
This fix ensures that when analyzing Parquet files, segments are presented in the order they appear in the file, making it easier to:
- Understand the file structure sequentially
- Perform byte-by-byte analysis
- Correlate segments with actual file offsets
- Debug file layout issues

The fix is minimal, non-breaking, and maintains all existing V2 functionality while improving the output quality.
